In recent times, there has been an increasing concern in India to develop effective civil service ethics, code of conduct, transparency measures, ethics and integrity systems and anti-corruption agencies. In view of this, there is need being felt to focus on three specific areas, which are directly relevant to the problems of internalizing integrity and ethics in the civil services. These are as follows:     1. Anticipating specific threats to ethical standards and integrity in the civil services,        2. Strengthening the ethical competence of civil servant and      3. Developing administrative processes and practices which promote ethical values and integrity in civil services.        Suggest institutional measures to address the above three issues.
